# Spatial Conditional Probability Maps

## Description

This Shiny R app takes data from climate extremes and processes them to produce spatial conditional probability maps, i.e., probability of extreme values of selected variable in the North American region given there was an extreme value of same variable in the reference location over the chosen timeframe.
