# Spatial Conditional Probability Maps

## Description

This Shiny eapp takes data from climate extremes and processes them to produce spatial conditional probability maps, i.e., probability of an extreme temperature given there was an extreme temperature in the reference location. This calculation is done over the past 35 years.
